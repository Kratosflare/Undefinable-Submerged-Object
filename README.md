# Undefinable-Submerged-Object
This map centers around the story of a navy seal sent on a mission to investigate a space orb that crash landed on a distant naval base and sank it to the bottom of the ocean!
It reveals areas of a destroyed base underwater that the player must investigate through to retrieve it. However, they're not alone! These hostile waters have both enemy soldiers who seek to retrieve and weaponize the orb for their gain in world domination and dangerous underwater life protecting their newfound home from invaders. It keeps the player on edge and explore through how the naval base and salvage it for what's left of it to progress through the level. For the sake of humanity, the player must get to the orb and find out what it is or what it does before it gets into the wrong hands.
